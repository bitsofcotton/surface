# Surface
With defined field matrix represents f : R^n to R^m, and with region g : \[- 1, 1\]^{n - 1} for continuous facets, calculate some 2^k steps after.

# Tips
With randtools meaning, f is described as tan(A \* x) == tan(A'' \* atan(x)) with invariants. And g is also described as tan x = tan(B t)

A recursive is described as tan(A''^k B t).
