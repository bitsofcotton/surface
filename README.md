# Surface
With defined field matrix represents f : R^n to R^m, and with region g : \[- 1, 1\]^{n - 1} for continuous facets, calculate some 2^k steps after.

# Tips
With randtools meaning, f is described as A \* tan\[x, B x\] == tan\[x+, B x+\] with invariants. And g is also described as tan x = B'tan\[t, B'' t\].

A recursive is described as A^k \* \[B' tan\[t, B'' t\]   tan\[B atan\[B'tan\[t, B'' t\]\]\] \].
