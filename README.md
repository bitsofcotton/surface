# Surface
Stub of planning, R^m surface on R^n simulator. (n &gt; m)
Or, can we choose the original space in R^n / f, f : &partial; D &rightarrow; &partial; D, D subset of R^n with speed?

# Draft
* initialize some set of potential 0 surfaces.
* append graph and potential to each surfaces.
* simulate (with 2^k steps with shortcut on matrix operation, not on vector.).
* reverse some conditions.
